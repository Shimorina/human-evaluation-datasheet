\section{Paper and Supplementary Resources (Questions 1.1--1.3)}\label{sec:paper-resources}

Questions 1.1--1.3 record bibliographic and related information. These are straightforward and don't warrant much in-depth explanation.

\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 1.1: Link to paper reporting the evaluation experiment. If the paper reports more than one experiment, state which experiment you're completing this sheet for. Or, if applicable, enter `for preregistration.'}
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{What to enter in the text box}: a link to an online copy of the main reference for the human evaluation experiment, identifying which of the experiments the form is being completed for if there are several. If the experiment hasn't been run yet, and the form is being completed for the purpose of submitting it for preregistration, simply enter `for preregistration'.

\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 1.2: Link to website providing resources used in the evaluation experiment (e.g.\ system outputs, evaluation tools, etc.). If there isn't one, enter `N/A'.}

\noindent\textit{What to enter in the text box}: names, affiliations and email addresses as appropriate. 



\section{System (Questions 2.1--2.5)}\label{sec:system}

Questions 2.1--2.5 record information about the system(s) (or human-authored stand-ins) whose outputs are evaluated in the Evaluation experiment that this sheet is being completed for.

The input, output, and task questions in this section are closely interrelated: the value for one partially determines the others, as indicated for some combinations in Question 2.3. 


\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 2.1: What type of input do the evaluated system(s) take? Select all that apply. If none match, select `Other' and describe.}\label{sec:input}
\vspace{-.1cm}

Describe the type of input, where input refers to the representations and/or data structures shared by all evaluated systems. 

This question is about input type, regardless of number. E.g.\ if the input is a set of documents, you would still select \textit{text: document} below. 

\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{Check-box options (select all that apply)}: 
\vspace{-.1cm}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\small $\square$}]
            \item \egcvalue{raw/structured data}: numerical, symbolic, and other data, possibly structured into trees, graphs, graphical models, etc. May be the input e.g.\ to Referring Expression Generation (REG), end-to-end text generation, etc. {NB}: excludes linguistic structures.
            
            \item \egcvalue{deep linguistic representation (DLR)}: any of a variety of deep, underspecified, semantic representations, such as abstract meaning representations \citep[AMRs;][]{banarescu-etal-2013-abstract} or discourse representation structures \citep[DRSs;][]{kamp-reyle2013discourse}.
            
            \item \egcvalue{shallow linguistic representation (SLR)}: any of a variety of shallow, syntactic representations, e.g.\ Universal Dependency (UD) structures; typically the input to surface realisation.
            
            \item \egcvalue{text: subsentential unit of text}: a unit of text shorter than a sentence, e.g.\ Referring Expressions (REs), verb phrase, text fragment of any length; includes titles/headlines.

            \item \egcvalue{text: multiple sentences}: a sequence of multiple sentences, without any document structure (or a set of such sequences). 
            
            \item \egcvalue{text: document}: a text with document structure, such as a title, paragraph breaks or sections, e.g.\ a set of news reports for summarisation.
            
            \item \egcvalue{text: dialogue}: a dialogue of any length, excluding a single turn which would come under one of the other text types.
            
            \item \egcvalue{text: other}: input is text but doesn't match any of the above \textit{text:*} categories.

            \item \egcvalue{multi-modal}: catch-all value for any combination of data and/or linguistic representation and/or visual data etc.
            
            \item \egcvalue{control feature}: a feature or parameter specifically present to control a property of the output text, e.g.\ positive stance, formality, author style.
            
            \item \egcvalue{no input (human generation)}: human generation\footnote{\label{human-generation}We use the term `human generation' where the items being evaluated have been created manually, rather than generated by an automatic system.}, therefore no system inputs.
            
            \item \egcvalue{other (please specify)}: if input is none of the above, choose this option and describe it. 
            
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 2.2: What type of output do the evaluated system(s) generate? Select all that apply. If none match, select `Other' and describe.}\label{sec:output}

Describe the type of input, where input refers to the representations and/or data structures shared by all evaluated systems. 

This question is about input type, regardless of number. E.g.\ if the output is a set of documents, you would still select \textit{text: document} below. 

Note that the options for outputs are the same as for inputs minus the \textit{control feature} option.

\vspace{-.1cm}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\small $\square$}]

        \end{enumerate}


\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 2.3: How would you describe the task that the evaluated system(s) perform in mapping the inputs in Q2.1 to the outputs in Q2.2? Occasionally, more than one of the options below may apply. If none match, select `Other' and describe.}\label{sec:task}
\vspace{-.1cm}

This field records the task performed by the system(s) being evaluated. This is independent of the application domain (financial reporting, weather forecasting, etc.), or the specific method (rule-based, neural, etc.) implemented in the system. We indicate mutual constraints between inputs, outputs and task for some of the options below. 
    

\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{Check-box options (select all that apply)}:  
\vspace{-.1cm}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\small $\square$}]
    \item \egcvalue{content selection/determination}: selecting  the specific content that will be expressed in the generated text from a representation of possible content. This could be attribute selection for REG (without the surface realisation step). Note that the output here is not text.
    
    \item \egcvalue{content ordering/structuring}: assigning an order and/or structure to content to be included in generated text. Note that the output here is not text.
    
    \item \egcvalue{aggregation}: converting inputs (typically \textit{deep linguistic representations} or \textit{shallow linguistic representations}) in some way in order to reduce redundancy (e.g.\  representations for `they like swimming', `they like running' $\rightarrow$ representation for `they like swimming and running').
   
    \item \egcvalue{referring expression generation}: generating \textit{text} to refer to a given referent, typically represented in the input as a set of attributes or a linguistic representation. 
    
    \item \egcvalue{lexicalisation}: associating (parts of) an input representation with specific lexical items to be used in their realisation. 
    
    \item \egcvalue{deep generation}: one-step text generation from \textit{raw/structured data} or \textit{deep linguistic representations}. One-step means that no intermediate representations are passed from one independently run module to another.
    
    \item \egcvalue{surface realisation (SLR to text)}: one-step text generation from \textit{shallow linguistic representations}. One-step means that no intermediate representations are passed from one independently run module to another.
    
    \item \egcvalue{feature-controlled text generation}: generation of text that varies along specific dimensions where the variation is controlled via \textit{control feature}s specified as part of the input. Input is a non-textual representation (for feature-controlled text-to-text generation select the matching text-to-text task). 
    
    \item \egcvalue{data-to-text generation}: generation from \textit{raw/structured data} which may or may not include some amount of content selection as part of the generation process. Output is likely to be \textit{text:*} or \textit{multi-modal}.
    
    \item \egcvalue{dialogue turn generation}: generating a dialogue turn (can be a greeting or closing) from a representation of dialogue state and/or last turn(s), etc. 

    \item \egcvalue{question generation}: generation of questions from given input text and/or knowledge base such that the question can be answered from the input.
    
    \item \egcvalue{question answering}: input is a question plus optionally a set of reference texts and/or knowledge base, and the output is the answer to the question.
    
    \item \egcvalue{paraphrasing/lossless simplification}: text-to-text generation where the aim is to preserve the meaning of the input while changing its wording. This can include the aim of changing the text on a given dimension, e.g.\ making it simpler, changing its stance or sentiment, etc., which may be controllable via input features. Note that this task type includes meaning-preserving text simplification (non-meaning preserving simplification comes under \textit{compression/lossy simplification} below).
    
    \item \egcvalue{compression/lossy simplification}: text-to-text generation that has the aim to generate a shorter, or shorter and simpler, version of the input text. This will normally affect meaning to some extent, but as a side effect, rather than the primary aim, as is the case in \textit{summarisation}.
    
    \item \egcvalue{machine translation}: translating text in a source language to text in a target language while maximally preserving the meaning. 
    
    \item \egcvalue{summarisation (text-to-text)}: output is an extractive or abstractive summary of the important/relevant/salient content of the input  document(s).

    \item \egcvalue{end-to-end text generation}: use this option if the single system task corresponds to more than one of tasks above, implemented either as separate modules pipelined together, or as one-step generation, other than \textit{deep generation} and \textit{surface realisation}.
    
    \item \egcvalue{image/video description}: input includes \textit{visual}, and the output describes it in some way.
    
    \item \egcvalue{post-editing/correction}: system edits and/or corrects the input text (typically itself the textual output from another system) to yield an improved version of the text.
       
    \item \egcvalue{other (please specify)}: if task is none of the above, choose this option and describe it.
    \end{enumerate}


\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 2.4: Input Language(s), or `N/A'.}
\vspace{-.1cm}

This field records the language(s) of the inputs accepted by the system(s) being evaluated.
        
\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{What to enter in the text box}: any  language name(s) that apply, mapped to standardised full language names in ISO 639-1\footnote{\label{iso}\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes}}. E.g.\ English, Herero, Hindi. 
If no language is accepted as (part of) the input, enter `N/A'.
        
\vspace{-.3cm}

    \item \egcvalue{by an automatic random process but using stratified sampling over given properties}: use this option if selection was by a random script as above, but with added constraints ensuring that the sample is representative of the set of outputs it was selected from, in terms of given properties, such as sentence length, positive/negative stance, etc.
    \item \egcvalue{by manual, arbitrary selection}: output sample was selected by hand, or automatically from a manually compiled list, without a specific selection criterion.
    \item \egcvalue{by manual selection aimed at achieving balance or variety relative to given properties}: selection by hand as above, but with specific selection criteria, e.g.\ same number of outputs from each time period.

\section{Quality Criterion \textit{n} -- Definition and Operationalisation}
\label{sec:criteria}

Questions in this section collect information about the $n$th quality criterion assessed in the single human evaluation experiment that this sheet is being completed for. The HEDS 1.0 form allows this section to be completed repeatedly, for up to 10 different quality criteria (see further explanation at the end of the section).

For more information, in particular about quality criterion properties and evaluation mode properties, see \citet{belz-etal-2020-disentangling}.


\subsection{Quality criterion properties (Questions 4.1.1--4.1.3)}

Questions 4.1.1--4.1.3 capture the aspect of quality that is assessed by a given quality criterion in terms of three orthogonal properties. They help determine e.g.\ whether or not the same aspect of quality is being evaluated in different evaluation experiments. The three properties characterise quality criteria in terms of (i) what type of quality is being assessed; (ii) what aspect of the system output is being assessed; and (iii) whether system outputs are assessed in their own right or with reference to some system-internal or system-external frame of reference.

\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.1.1:  What type of quality is assessed by the quality criterion?}
\vspace{-.1cm}

\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{Multiple-choice options (select one)}:  
\vspace{-.1cm}

%%% AB: wording same as in INLG paper, keep
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\LARGE $\circ$}]
    \item \egcvalue{Correctness}: select this option if it is possible to state,  generally for all outputs,  the conditions under which outputs are maximally correct (hence of maximal quality).  E.g.\ for Grammaticality, outputs are (maximally) correct if they contain no grammatical errors; for Semantic Completeness, outputs are correct if they express all the content in the input.
    \item \egcvalue{Goodness}: select this option if, in contrast to correctness criteria, there is no single, general mechanism for deciding when outputs are maximally good, only for deciding for two outputs which is better and which is worse. E.g.\ for Fluency, even if outputs contain no disfluencies, there may be other ways in which any given output could be more fluent.
    \item \egcvalue{Features}: choose this option if, in terms of property $X$ captured by the criterion, outputs are not generally better if they are more $X$, but instead, depending on evaluation context, more $X$ may be better or less $X$ may be better. E.g.\ outputs can be more specific or less specific, but itâ€™s not the case that outputs are, in the general case, better when they are more specific.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Question 4.1.2:  Which aspect of system outputs is assessed by the quality criterion?}
\vspace{-.1cm}

\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{Multiple-choice options (select one)}:  
\vspace{-.1cm}

%%% AB: wording same as in INLG paper, keep
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\LARGE $\circ$}]
    \item \egcvalue{Form of output}: choose this option if the criterion assesses the form of outputs alone, e.g.\ Grammaticality is only about the form, a sentence can be grammatical yet be wrong or nonsensical in terms of content.
    \item \egcvalue{Content of output}: choose this option if the criterion assesses the content/meaning of the output alone, e.g.\ Meaning Preservation only assesses output content; two sentences can be considered to have the same meaning, but differ in form.
    \item \egcvalue{Both form and content of output}: choose this option if the criterion assesses outputs as a whole, not just form or just content. E.g.\ Coherence is a property of outputs as a whole, either form or meaning can detract from it.
\end{enumerate}


%\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.1.3: Is each output assessed for quality in its own right, or with reference to a system-internal or external frame of reference?}
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{Multiple-choice options (select one)}:  
\vspace{-.1cm}

%%% AB: wording same as in INLG paper, keep
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\LARGE $\circ$}]
    \item \egcvalue{Quality of output in its own right}: choose this option if output quality is assessed without referring to anything other than the output itself, i.e.\ no  system-internal or external frame of reference. E.g.\ Poeticness is assessed by considering (just) the output and how poetic it is. 
    \item \egcvalue{Quality of output relative to the input}:  choose this option if output quality is assessed  relative to the input. E.g.\ Answerability is the degree to which the output question can be answered from information in the input.
    \item \egcvalue{Quality of output relative to a system-external frame of reference}: choose this option if output quality is assessed with reference to system-external information, such as a knowledge base, a personâ€™s individual writing style, or the performance of an embedding system. E.g.\ Factual Accuracy assesses outputs relative to a source of real-world knowledge.
\end{enumerate}
    

    
\subsection{Evaluation mode properties (Questions 4.2.1--4.2.3)}

Questions 4.2.1--4.2.3 record properties that are orthogonal to quality criteria, i.e.\ any given quality criterion can in principle be combined with any of the modes (although some combinations are more common than others). 

\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.2.1: Does an individual assessment involve an objective or a subjective judgment?}
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{Multiple-choice options (select one)}:  
\vspace{-.1cm}

%%% AB: wording same as in INLG paper, keep
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\LARGE $\circ$}]
    \item \egcvalue{Objective}: Examples of objective assessment include any automatically counted or otherwise quantified measurements such as mouse-clicks, occurrences in text, etc. Repeated assessments of the same output with an objective-mode evaluation method always yield the same score/result.
    \item \egcvalue{Subjective}: Subjective assessments involve ratings, opinions and preferences by evaluators. Some criteria lend themselves more readily to subjective assessments, e.g.\ Friendliness of a conversational agent, but an objective measure e.g.\ based on lexical markers is also conceivable.
\end{enumerate}
    
%\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.2.2: Are outputs assessed in absolute or relative terms?}
\vspace{-.1cm}

\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{Multiple-choice options (select one)}:  
\vspace{-.1cm}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\LARGE $\circ$}]
    \item \egcvalue{Absolute}: choose this option if evaluators are shown outputs from a single system during each individual assessment. 
    \item \egcvalue{Relative}: choose this option if evaluators are shown outputs from multiple systems at the same time during assessments, typically ranking or preference-judging them.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.2.3: Is the evaluation intrinsic or extrinsic?}
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{Multiple-choice options (select one)}:  
\vspace{-.1cm}

%%% AB: wording same as in INLG paper, keep
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\LARGE $\circ$}]
    \item \egcvalue{Intrinsic}: Choose this option if quality of outputs is assessed \textit{without} considering their \textit{effect} on something external to the system, e.g.\ the performance of an embedding system or of a user at a task.
    \item \egcvalue{Extrinsic}: Choose this option if quality of outputs is assessed in terms of their \textit{effect} on something external to the system such as the performance of an embedding system or of a user at a task.
\end{enumerate}

   
\subsection{Response elicitation (Questions 4.3.1--4.3.11)}

Questions 4.3.1--4.3.11 record information about how responses are elicited for the quality criterion this section is being completed for.

\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.3.1: What do you call the quality criterion in explanations/interfaces to evaluators?  Enter `N/A' if criterion not named.}
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{What to enter in the text box}: the name you use to refer to the quality criterion in explanations and/or interfaces created for evaluators. Examples of quality criterion names include Fluency, Clarity, Meaning Preservation. If no name is used, state `N/A'.

%\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.3.2:  What definition do you give for the quality criterion in explanations/interfaces to evaluators? Enter `N/A' if no definition given.}
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{What to enter in the text box}: Copy and past the verbatim definition you give to evaluators to explain the quality criterion they're assessing. If you don't explicitly call it a definition, enter the nearest thing to a definition you give them.  If you don't give any definition, state `N/A'.

%\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.3.3:  Size of scale or other rating instrument (i.e.\ how many different possible values there are). Answer should be an integer or `continuous' (if it's not possible to state how many possible responses there are). Enter `N/A' if there is no rating instrument.}
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{What to enter in the text box}: The number of different response values for this quality criterion. E.g.\ for a 5-point Likert scale, the size to enter is 5. For two-way forced-choice preference judgments, it is 2; if there's also a no-preference option, enter 3. For a slider that is mapped to 100 different values for the purpose of recording assessments, the size to enter is 100. If no rating instrument is used (e.g.\ when evaluation gathers post-edits or qualitative feedback only), enter `N/A'.

%\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.3.4: List or range of possible values of the scale or other rating instrument. Enter `N/A', if there is no rating instrument.} 
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{What to enter in the text box}: list, or give the range of, the possible values  of the rating instrument. The list or range should be of the size specified in Question 4.3.3. If there are too many to list, use a range. E.g.\ for two-way forced-choice preference judgments, the list entered might be \textit{A better, B better}; if there's also a no-preference option, the list 
might be \textit{A better, B better, neither}. For a slider that is mapped to 100 different values for the purpose of recording assessments, the range \textit{1--100} might be entered. If no rating instrument is used (e.g.\ when evaluation gathers post-edits or qualitative feedback only), enter 'N/A'.

%\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.3.5:  How is the scale or other rating instrument presented to evaluators? If none match, select `Otherâ€™ and describe.}
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{Multiple-choice options (select one)}:  
\vspace{-.1cm}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\LARGE $\circ$}]
    \item \egcvalue{Multiple-choice options}: choose this option if evaluators select exactly one of multiple options.
    \item \egcvalue{Check-boxes}: choose this option if evaluators select any number of options from multiple given options.
    \item \egcvalue{Slider}: choose this option if evaluators move a pointer on a slider scale to the position corresponding to their assessment.
    \item \egcvalue{N/A (there is no rating instrument)}: choose this option if there is no rating instrument.
    \item \egcvalue{Other (please specify)}: choose this option if there is a rating instrument, but none of the above adequately describe the way you present it to evaluators. Use the text box to describe the rating instrument and link to a screenshot.
\end{enumerate}

%\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.3.6:  If there is no rating instrument, describe briefly what task the evaluators perform (e.g.\ ranking multiple outputs, finding information, playing a game, etc.), and what information is recorded. Enter `N/A' if there is a rating instrument.}
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{What to enter in the text box}:  If (and only if) there is no rating instrument, i.e.\ you entered `N/A' for Questions 4.3.3--4.3.5, describe the task evaluators perform in this space. Otherwise, here enter `N/A' if there \textit{is} a rating instrument.

%\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.3.7:  What is the verbatim question, prompt or instruction given to evaluators (visible to them during each individual assessment)?  }
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{What to enter in the text box}:  Copy and paste the verbatim text that evaluators see during each assessment, that is intended to convey the evaluation task to them. E.g.\ \textit{Which of these texts do you prefer?} Or \textit{Make any corrections to this text that you think are necessary in order to improve it to the point where you would be happy to provide it to a client.} 

%\vspace{-.3cm}
\subsection*{Question 4.3.8:  Form of response elicitation. If none match, select `Other' and describe.}
%\vspace{-.1cm}

%\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{Multiple-choice options (select one)}:\footnote{Explanations adapted from \citet{howcroft-etal-2020-twenty}.}
\vspace{-.1cm}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0cm,leftmargin=0.5cm,label={\LARGE $\circ$}]
    \item \egcvalue{(dis)agreement with quality statement}: Participants specify the degree to which they agree with a given quality statement by indicating their agreement on a rating instrument. The rating instrument is labelled with degrees of agreement and can additionally have numerical labels.  E.g.\ \textit{This text is fluent --- 1=strongly disagree...5=strongly agree}.
    \item \egcvalue{direct quality estimation}: Participants are asked to provide a rating using a rating instrument, which typically (but not always) mentions the quality criterion explicitly. E.g.\ \textit{How fluent is this text? --- 1=not at all fluent...5=very fluent}.
    \item \egcvalue{relative quality estimation (including ranking)}: Participants evaluate two or more items in terms of which is better.
    E.g.\ \textit{Rank these texts in terms of fluency}; \textit{Which of these texts is more fluent?}; \textit{Which of these items do you prefer?}.
    \item \egcvalue{counting occurrences in text}: Evaluators are asked to count how many times some type of phenomenon occurs, e.g.\ the number of facts contained in the output that are inconsistent with the input.
    \item \egcvalue{qualitative feedback (e.g.\ via comments entered in a text box)}: Typically, these are responses to open-ended questions in a survey or interview.
    \item \egcvalue{evaluation through post-editing/annotation}: Choose this option if the evaluators' task consists of editing or inserting annotations in text. E.g.\ evaluators may perform error correction and edits are then automatically measured to yield a numerical score.
    \item \egcvalue{output classification or labelling}: Choose this option if evaluators assign outputs to categories. E.g.\ \textit{What is the overall sentiment of this piece of text? --- Positive/neutral/negative.}
    \item \egcvalue{user-text interaction measurements}: choose this option if participants in the evaluation experiment interact with a text in some way, and measurements are taken of their interaction. E.g.\ reading speed, eye movement tracking, comprehension questions, etc. Excludes situations where participants are given a task to solve and their performance is measured which comes under the next option.
    \item \egcvalue{task performance measurements}: choose this option if participants in the evaluation experiment are given a task to perform, and measurements are taken of their performance at the task.  E.g.\ task is finding information, and task performance measurement is task completion speed and success rate.
    \item \egcvalue{user-system interaction measurements}: choose this option if participants in the evaluation experiment interact with a system in some way, while measurements are taken of their interaction. E.g.\ duration of interaction, hyperlinks followed, number of likes, or completed sales.
    \item \egcvalue{Other (please specify)}: Use the text box to describe the form of response elicitation used in assessing the quality criterion if it doesn't fall in any of the above categories.

\vspace{-.1cm}

\vspace{.3cm}
\noindent\textit{What to enter in the text box}:  normally a set of separate assessments is collected from evaluators and is converted to the results as reported. Describe here the method(s) used in the conversion(s). E.g.\ macro-averages or micro-averages are computed from numerical scores to provide summary, per-system results.

\vspace{-.3cm}
